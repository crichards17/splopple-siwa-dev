# Sign In With Apple testing

## Purpose

This repo is a sandbox environment in which I built a test implementation of Apple's Sign In WIth Apple authentication protocol, with the intention of implementing this into the [Splopple playlist app](https://github.com/crichards17/splopple-music). This was a fun challenge and I was able to get this working in sandbox, but project timeline required rescoping and SIWA was dropped from the final Splopple app.

## Technologies

Apple documentation for SIWA can be found here:
